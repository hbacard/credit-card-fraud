# Credit card fraud detection

We build an ML model that detects fraudulent credit card transactions. 

- Download the dataset from Kaggle ("creditcard.csv"). The link is in the notebook.
- Create a python virtual environment using for example `python3 -m venv .venv` on Linux based systems or Macs
- Activate the environment with `source .venv/bin/activate`
- Install all dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Create a directory "data" and move the downloaded csv in that directory.
- Run the notebook.
